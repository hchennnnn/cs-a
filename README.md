q1:
the question is about a simulation of amount of food that the bird will eat in a day and there is a 5% chance that bear will eat all of the food.The struggle part of the question is how to determine wether there will be a bear and eat all of the food or not.There is a helpful method in math class(Math.random) which can help to complete this simulation and this method return a random double > 0 and < 1 by using this method you can set a range which only 5% of the value in random will be return and any time these number is been return the 5% chance is happing and all the food will be eated.By doing this question I learn 

q2:
this question is about writing a class called board game and the game contain two method get score and record game which return the score of two team and update the active team and their score.The struggle part of this question is how to determine which team is active.The question tells that at beginning of the game team one is always the active team so you can make a variable of either string or boolean to record the current active team.Once you know the active team you can use two if statement to check if the score is a 0 or not and which team is active and change the non active team into active

q3:
this question is about arraylist called word checker it contain two method is word chain and create list the struggle part of this question is how to check if the current index of the array list contain previous string in the array list but there is a method called index of which return the index of first letter of that word if the current string contain the previous word otherwise it return -1 so you just need to use a loop to trace over all the value in the list and see if the index of previous string is -1 in the current string or not if it is return false else after the end of the loop return true.

q4:
this question is about 2d array which intend to find the path that sum in the smallest value until it reach the bottom right corner.This question need to write two method the struggle part of this question is to determine if the row and column reach the bottom right corner and since it a 2d array you can treat this as a quadralateral and the end point is always the area of the quadralateral so in the while loop as long as the product of row and column is not equal to the area of the 2d array the loop keeps running.
